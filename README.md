The goal of this project is to develop a game recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations to video gamers to purchase a new game. The dataset provided by Kaggle contains information on over 200,000 video games available on Steam. The dataset includes attributes such as game title, user ID, whether the user has purchased the game or played and playtime. The technology stack and development tools that will be used in this project are Python as the language, Pyspark as the big data framework, Google Colab and Kaggle IDE as the development environments, Github as the integration platform, and several Python libraries such as Pyspark, Numpy, CSV, and Pandas. The model will be implemented using multiple algorithms such as Cosine Similarity, Matrix Factorization. Will try to implement classification in addition to recommendation if possible. With develop the recommendation model with multiple algorithms and evaluate the performance and results.
