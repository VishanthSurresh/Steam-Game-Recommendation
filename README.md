### PROJECT SUMMARY
The gaming industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, with millions of gamers around the world spending countless hours playing their favorite games.With such a vast collection of games available, it can be challenging for gamers to find new games that align with their preferences.The Goal of this project is to develop a Game Recommendation System that provides personalized recommendations to video gamers to purchase a new game on Steam Website. 

Steam is the world's most popular PC Gaming hub, with over 6,000 games and a community of millions of gamers. The dataset provided by Kaggle contains information on over 200,000 purchases on multiple video games available on Steam. This dataset contains a list of user behaviors, with attributes: User-ID, Game-title, Behavior-name, value. The behaviors included are 'purchase' and 'play'. The value indicates the degree to which the behavior was performed - in the case of 'purchase' the value is always 1, and in the case of 'play' the value represents the number of hours the user has played the game.

In addition, we generated few features from the existing attributes, which will be very helpful for the recommendation system, For Example: Game Ratings. In this project will be implementing the following stages, Missing Values Handling, Outliers Detection, Feature Addition, Feature Selection, Exploratory Data Analysis, Hyper Parameter Tuning, Training, Testing and Validation of Machine learning model. The technology stack and development tools that will be used in this project are Python as the language, Pyspark as the Big Data framework, Google Colab and Kaggle IDE as the development environments, Github as the integration platform, and several Python libraries such as Pyspark, Numpy, CSV, and Pandas.The algorithms we are planning to implement to develop our model are Cosine Similarity, Matrix Factorization and other algorithms in Scikit Learn. Our research mostly focus on building the recommendation system with multiple algorithms and evaluate the performance between them. 

Furthermore, in addition to the recommendation system, classification algorithms will also be implemented to classify user behavior. This will help in understanding the user's preferences, which can further enhance the recommendations provided by the system. In conclusion, the development of a game recommendation system is an essential project in the gaming industry. The performance of these algorithms will be evaluated to determine the best algorithm that provides the most accurate and efficient recommendations for the users.
